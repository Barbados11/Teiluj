                <h1>Who may you ask, is Juliet?</h1>
                <p>To begin, I am originally from Bremen,Germany but brought up in Canada. I am a very open minded person, interested about
                    the world, and people from various backgrounds. I love learning and exploring this beautiful planet.

                        <h1>But, why would I choose to be a developer?</h1>
                        <p>There has always been a vested interest in coding, however, during quarantine it gave me the downtime to fully immerse myself.
                            Initially, what originally started as a hobby, started to develop into an intellectual curiousity; to make a career move towards tech.
                            The challenges and hurdles that come with coding, are worth the growth and constant push that come along with it. In my opinion, a career that
                            grows an individual, with constant growth opportunities, is a career that offers fulfillment: and that is how I feel for coding.

                                <p> My ambitions within Dialexa, span farther than my initial job requirements. Ideally, I would love to transition into being a 
                                    Full-stack Developer within Dialexa, through the mentorship program. As well, I love the fact that Dialexa supports, creativity, innovation
                                and intellectual curiousity; because I would love to develop new inventions, including an application. And being a part of a work environment, where
                            not only is it supported, but also encouraged. Truly amplifies my vetted interest in Dialexa. </p>
